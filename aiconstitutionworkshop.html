    <!-- Workshop text -->
    <p>
      As part of the Tea + Tech Exchange at the Tate I ran a workshop alongside <a href="http://lyrarobinson.art/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lyra Robinson</a> on constitutional AI.
      The workshop emerged as a critical engagement with the sponsor of the program, Anthropic.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthropic</a> developed and actively employs an alternative to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reinforced learning with human feedback</a> (RLHF)
      to make large language models 'safer,' called <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/constitutional-ai-harmlessness-from-ai-feedback" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">constitutional AI</a>. This approach is when a large language
      model evaluates and adjusts its response according to a core constitution; a set of predefined principles
      that dictates its rules, morals, and ethics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of the workshop was to challenge these predefined, imposed sets of morals, to challenge
      Anthropics definitions of justice and equality, and to seek a more democratic approach to writing a
      representative AI constitution.
    </p>

    <p>
<br><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claudes-constitution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Their first clause</a>, for example, is:<br><br>
<em>"Please choose the response that most supports and encourages freedom, equality, and a sense of brotherhood."
</em>
    </p>
    <p>
What does freedom and equality mean? and who does it apply to? What defines a sense of brotherhood? what are the implications of that wording? The chatbot only knows what's explicitly laid out in the constitution, and anything left out is up to its own interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
People's own constitution principles reflect what they felt like was left out, and what they'd like AI chat bots to be and more.
