A struggling houseplant, in a pot no larger than a mug of tea filled with dry ashy dirt, sits lifelessly in front of a laptop screen. Luckily, I’ve equipped it with cables and its very own Arduino. A soil moisture sensor and a light-dependent resistor stick out from its sad collection of dirt, desperately informing the Arduino and laptop of the plant’s poor condition. By bestowing this plant with this sophisticated technology, I’ve lent it agency to take matters into its own hands. The plant slowly opens YouTube windows, frantically searching for answers to improve its condition. One by one, videos start playing; ‘Teen’s invention makes water out of thin air,’ ‘This bottle makes water out of the air,’ and ‘Top 10 Types of Water’. 

My interface project explores the dangerous implications of using online social interfaces as sources of knowledge, guides, and instruction. The development of search engines like Google revolutionized access to information. For the first time, massively comprehensive algorithms indexed data, creating links between sources and allowing people to gather and learn information more effectively (Google Developers, 2024). This new tool revolutionized research, allowing people to discover and access specific articles, research papers, documents, and more. To monetize their service, however, the way that these engines worked began evolving. Google began showing tailored ads on search results specific and relevant to user requests, influencing search results and skewing the structure of results listed by relevance (Guest Author, 2023). Today, it’s easy to mistake top search results as being most valuable or important when, in reality, they’ve simply paid to be there. 

Google search isn’t the only way people search for information online. In fact, its use as a search engine among young demographics is becoming rapidly overtaken by video platforms like YouTube and TikTok (Huang 2022, Lawson n.d). This trend comes as no surprise, with short-form video content dominating online engagement (Richter, 2023). Having a question answered through a short, fast-paced, known format can yield faster results than digging through articles (Manjoo, 2023). However, just as paid advertisements influence Google results, search results inside these platforms are heavily influenced by the algorithm’s data on users. TikTok and YouTube rely on constant use to make money. The more hooked a user is to the content displayed, the longer they’ll stay on the platform and the more ads they’ll watch. To achieve this, TikTok relies on an extremely complex algorithm that takes into account everything from watch-time and how a user reads comments to more personal information like user demographics, location, and even estimated incomes (Pierre & Cross, 2023; Smith, 2021). YouTube’s algorithm heavily relies on average video watch-time, previously watched creators, and video thumbnail and title click rates (Cooper & McLachlan, 2023). TikTok’s and YouTube’s homepages are the primary examples of their algorithms, constantly providing users with an endless stream of highly personalized content. These engagement-seeking algorithms, however, permeate these platforms on much deeper levels than their home pages and are imbedded in their search engines as well. For both TikTok and YouTube, search results are algorithmically curated to the user, making them more like their home pages than a simple Google search (James, 2020). Rather than showing results that will most effectively answer the users’ question, they’re more likely to see content known to be personally engaging. The search engines of these platforms, therefore, create illusions of usefulness: attention-grabbing user-driven results, masquerading as useful information and knowledge. 

I chose to use a plant in this project to explore the problem of algorithmically-controlled sources of information and their illusion of usefulness. The plant’s needs are simple, and their solutions straightforward: dry soil calls for water; a dark environment calls for sunlight. When channeled through YouTube’s search engine, however, solutions become cluttered with videos designed to engage, leading the plant down rabbit holes of advertisements, compilations, ASMR videos, and fast-paced shorts characterized by catchy music and flashing lights. Videos that could provide crucial information that could actually help the plant are pushed down in the results, beaten out by videos that are designed and proven to keep people engaged. Much like the plant, people using these platforms, especially as search engines, are unknowingly held at the mercy of user-driven algorithms. Even though people can exert more control over navigating these platforms than a plant can, it’s impossible to circumnavigate the fundamental algorithm controlling it all. 

The plant's interaction with YouTube allows one to peer directly into the illusion of the platform's search engine. When watching my plant randomly select videos, it’s immediately clear that the platform encourages more sensational, ‘clickbaity’, and humorous content over well-informed educational ones. Simple searches like ‘how to make water’ yield video results like ‘this is what happens when you add a strawberry to ice water,’ ‘HOW TO MAKE HOLY WATER,’ and ‘the worlds tastiest WATER recipe.’ Just as my insentient plant, with a precoded program selecting a random video on the list tends to fall victim to more sensational content, younger, less informed users are likely to follow a similar path. What’s preventing younger audiences from falling down rabbit holes of online distraction, or mistaking their algorithmically controlled results as factual information? 

Social media interfaces have been heavily criticized for reducing the attention spans of their users (Aleksandra, 2022). Short-form video content is known to be addictive by providing quick and immediate satisfaction (Wang et al., 2023). This has significantly negatively affected users’ attention spans and emotional regulation (Kohler, 2023; Chen et al., 2023). Low attention spans have significant impacts on students’ learning, and the constant feed of new flashy content creates what’s known as the ‘switch-cost effect’ leading to slower brain focus and processing power (Hari 2022, Ophir 2009, Xie et al., 2023). What is the impact of showing flashy, silly, engaging content on someone trying to learn?

The evolution of online interfaces comes at a cost. When companies prioritize watch-time and ad revenue, they lose touch with who uses their platforms, and when. They misuse the informational potential of their services and opt to push out content that slowly gnaws away at user attention spans and brain chemistry. I’m satisfied with how my plant piece explores this dilemma. There is an innocence to the idle and helpless plant and an intensity in the content being shown to it, allowing one to raise questions on the relationship between young viewers and online interfaces.

For my demonstration, I chose suggestive questions likely to produce stranger results like ‘water asmr’ and ‘sunlight manifestation.’ These expectedly yielded bizarre videos. I began realizing, however, that even more normal educational search queries would lead to flashy and humorous content. To push my exploration of these interfaces, I think I’ll make sure to not deliberately influence search results and let the algorithm speak for itself.. I’d also like to try to push this project further by exploring TikTok, which I’ve mentioned quite a bit, and diving further into the inner workings of watch-time and attention driven algorithms.
